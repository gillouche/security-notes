= Web application hacking

== BurpSuite
One-stop shop for web application & mobile app penetration testing. Burp can capture and manipulate all the traffic (request and response) between an attacker and a webserver. Burp exists in Community, Professional and Enterprise editions.

|===
|Feature |Description

|Proxy
|Intercept and modify requests/responses when interacting with web applications

|Repeater
|Capture, modify, then resend the same request numerous times. Good for when we need to craft a payload through trial and error (SQL Injection) or testing the functionality of an endpoint for flaws

|Intruder
|Rate limited in Community edition. Spray an endpoint with requests (bruteforce, fuzz). Use a proxied request with slightly different info between each request (login, ...)

|Decoder
|Transform data (decoding, encoding payload)

|Comparer
|Compare piece of data (word, byte level)

|Sequencer
|Assess randomness of tokens (session cookie or any random generate data)

|Extender
|Install extension from Bapp store or create our own in Java, Python (Jython) and Ruby (JRuby)

=== Proxy
Two ways to proxy our traffic:

* use the embedded browser
* configure local web browser to proxy our traffic through Burp (most common) -> use FoxyProxy addon

For HTTPS proxying, we need to add Burp cert to add the CA certificate to our list of trusted certificate authorities.

Scoping: configure what gets proxied and logged to ignore proxy traffic to websites we aren't targeting. This is done in Target menu + Proxy Options (Intercept Client Requests -> and URL is in target scope)

=== Intruder

|===
|Attack Type |Description |Number of requests

|Sniper
|One set of payloads (wordlist, range of numbers). Intruder sequentially tries all payload in each defined position in turn
|numberOfWords * numberOfPositions

|Battering Ram
|One set of payloads. Intruder tries the same payload in every positions.
|numberOfWords

|Pitchfork
|Like having numerous Snipers running simultaneously. Uses one payload set per position (max 20) and iterates through them all at once.
|min number of a list

|Cluster Bomb
|Multiple payload sets: one per position, up to max 20. Iterates through each payload set individually -> ensure every possible combination of payloads is tested.
|number of list 1 * number of list 2 * ...

|===

== Gobuster
Brute force website to find hidden directories and pages using a word list.

|===
|Argument |Description
|-u |URL of the website
|-w |PATH to word list file
|===

== OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)
Security testing framework like Burp Suite -> robust enumeration tool, test web applications.

|===
|Feature |Description

|Automated Web Application Scan
|Auto passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities.

|Web Spidering
|Passively build a website map with Spidering

|Unthrottled Intruder
|Bruteforce login

|Auto forward request
|OWASP intercept requests automatically, not need to forward individual requests to OWASP

|Extensions
|Can add extensions from github.com/zaproxy/zap-extensions and other repositories.

BurpSuite to ZAP

* Site Map -> Site Tree
* HTTP History -> History
* Scope -> Context
* Intercepter -> Break
* Repeater -> Request Editor
* Intruder -> Fuzzer
* Scanner -> Active Scan
* BApp Store -> Add On Marketplace

== Automated Scan
Traditional spider -> builds website index without brute-forcing; much quieter than bruteforce but not as comprehensive

Ajax spider -> add-on that integrates in ZAP a crawler of AJAX rich sites called CrawlJax. Can be used with traditional spider for better results. It uses our web browser and proxy.

We need to import ZAP SSL certificate and configure our browser proxy for ZAP.
