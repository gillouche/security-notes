= Database

== Schemas
In MySQL, the schema is a synonym of database. For others, there is a distinction. For Oracle, the schema represents only a part of a database: the tables and other objects owned by a single user

== Hashes
Used for indexes -> turn a variable length input into a fixed length output

== Structured Query Language (SQL)

=== UNION
Combine results of two or more SELECT statements from either single or multiple tables. UNION statements must retrieve the same number of columns in each SELECT statement, columns must be same data type and column order has to be the same.

== SQLite
Use flat files to store data.
